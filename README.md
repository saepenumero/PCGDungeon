# PCGDungeon
##### Search-based procedural dungeon generator
This application allows the user to create a 50x50 level for a rogue-like game. The level consists of walls, empty spaces, monsters, items, an entrance and an exit. The application has been written in C++ for high performance and can be compiled to a .dll file so that it can be imported to other languages.
